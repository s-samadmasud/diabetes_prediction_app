## Diabetes Prediction App

This is a Flask application that predicts whether someone has diabetes based on a set of user-provided medical features.

**Features:**

* User interface for entering medical data.
* Prediction based on a trained machine learning model.
* Dynamic result display with color highlighting (green for "No Diabetes", red for "Diabetes").

**Requirements:**

* Python 3.10.0
* Flask
* NumPy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn (or other machine learning library) - for loading the model
* Pickle - for loading the trained model
* matplotlib
* seaborn
  

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (assuming you have a `requirements.txt` file listing the dependencies).
3. Download your trained diabetes prediction model (`.pkl` file) and place it in the same directory as your application files.

**Usage:**

1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser.
3. Enter your medical data in the form fields.
4. Click the "Predict" button.
5. The application will display the predicted outcome ("No Diabetes" or "Diabetes") with a corresponding color highlight.

**Files:**

* `app.py`: Contains the Flask application logic, handles user input, prediction, and renders the templates.
* `index.html`: The user interface for entering medical data.
* `result.html`: The template for displaying the prediction result.
* `style.css` (optional): Provides styles for the user interface (optional).
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python libraries.
* `diabetes_analysis_model.pkl`: The trained diabetes prediction model (needs to be downloaded separately).
